TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock CLK_01/inst/i_clk_100MHz is created on an inappropriate internal pin CLK_01/inst/i_clk_100MHz. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks RECON_01/MB_01/mb_pr_01_i/mdm_0/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and o_clk_16MHz_clk_wiz_0 (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks RECON_01/MB_01/mb_pr_01_i/mdm_0/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and o_clk_16MHz_clk_wiz_0 (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net i_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): B_7SEG/i_clk, CLK_01/i_clk_100MHz, i_clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell RECON_01/MB_01/mb_pr_01_i/mdm_0/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) RECON_01/MB_01/mb_pr_01_i/mdm_0/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
